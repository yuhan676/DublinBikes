<@1154364781185216512> <@690522374277169212> We are trying to all have access to the same EC2 instance. 
Would it be best If I shared my AWS credentials with them so they can start and stop the instance via AWS? 
Or is there another way around this?
........
The proper way to do this is with Identity Access Management and AWS have extensive support for sharing all kinds of configs and credentials: https://aws.amazon.com/iam/. There is a little overhead to getting this set up- let me know how you get on.
It is sometimes convenient to start/stop instance from the command line with AWS CLI, and this can work with shared credentials: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.html
