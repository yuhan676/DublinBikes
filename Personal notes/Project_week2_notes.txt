How to use OpenWeather. Can use requests instead of get
To use the OpenWeather API, you'll need to sign up for an API key, which will allow you to make requests to their server and retrieve weather data. Here's a basic overview of how to use the OpenWeather API:

1. **Sign up for an API Key**: Go to the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free or paid account. Once you've signed up, you'll receive an API key, which you'll need to include in your API requests.

2. **API Documentation**: Review the [OpenWeather API documentation](https://openweathermap.org/api) to understand the available endpoints, parameters, and response formats. This documentation will provide you with the necessary information to construct your API requests.

3. **Make API Requests**: Once you have your API key and understand the documentation, you can start making API requests to retrieve weather data. Here's a basic example using a simple HTTP GET request:

    ```
    GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}
    ```

    Replace `{city name}` with the name of the city for which you want to retrieve weather data, and `{API key}` with your actual API key.

4. **Handle API Responses**: The response from the OpenWeather API will be in JSON format. You'll need to parse this JSON response in your code to extract the weather data you're interested in (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).

5. **Rate Limits**: Be aware of any rate limits or usage restrictions associated with the OpenWeather API, especially if you're using a free account. Ensure that your application adheres to these limits to avoid being blocked from making further requests.

6. **Error Handling**: Handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during API requests, such as network errors or invalid responses from the server.

Here's a simple example in Python using the `requests` library to make an API request to retrieve current weather data for a specific city:

```python
import requests

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
city_name = 'London'

url = f'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city_name}&appid={API_KEY}'
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print('Weather in {}:'.format(city_name))
    print('Temperature:', data['main']['temp'])
    print('Humidity:', data['main']['humidity'])
else:
    print('Error:', response.status_code)
```

Remember to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenWeather API key. This is just a basic example to get you started. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may need to make different types of requests and handle the response data accordingly.
